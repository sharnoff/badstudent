Common tags used in these files are:
	@OPTIMIZE	- place where the operations could be performed significantly faster
	@CONSTANT	- set of operations that use built in constants
	@CHANGE		- misc tag to define other things that need to be done
	@IN_PROGRESS- self explanatory

These are mainly to help me, so that I can access all of the changes that I'm planning on making without 
internet or a need to consult github
