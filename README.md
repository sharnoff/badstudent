# smartlearning

Smartlearning is divided into a few parts:
* smartlearn - the package of all of the neural network handling functions
  * segmenttypes - a sub-package containing all of the different types of operations one might wish to have in a neural network
* cmd - some examples of the system working, using a simple xor-learning network and a network designed to train from the mnist csv dataset

Smartlearning was designed to make more complex neural network structures (with separate paths) simpler to work with. It's also helped me in my journey to understand more of deep learning.


Future features:
* Custom cost/error functions
* Custom optimization functions for built in segment types
* Custom functions for variable learning rates (Î±)
* Saving/loading of networks
