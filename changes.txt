List of ongoing changes in the code:
	r - refactoring
	o - optimizing

	All being done in one fell swoop:
	r 	Segment function members to take fewer parameters
	r 	Segment.inputDeltas() to output a channel
	r/o	Segment.inValues to share the base array with the values of the inputs
			- Network.inputs/outputs to be a singular slice, in the same manner
			-> Obviously, this can't always work, but it should for most of the time
	r	SegmentType to be in accordance with the changes to Network.NewSegment
	r	some Segment methods to use setAllCalcAbove()

	Something to add in: allow for different error functions (other than just squared error)

The reason I'm not using github issues is that I prefer to have the things that I'm working on closer to me,
and the fact that no one else is working on this means that it doesn't matter.
